## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**PunkRacerz/PunkRacerz** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... A game based on the solana blockchain where people are able to vote for their favourite racers using $punk tokens. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... How to code from scratch haha, hopefully its ok.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ... no collaborations, this is a personal project.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: ... punkracerz@outlook.com or @pnkracerz on.
I hope you guys enjoy watching this get created.
